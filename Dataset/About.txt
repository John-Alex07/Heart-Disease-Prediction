There are 13 attributes:

Age: Age (in years)
Sex: gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
ChestPain: Chest Pain type
-- typical angina (all criteria present)
-- atypical angina (two of three criteria satisfied)
-- non-anginal pain (less than one criteria satisfied)
-- asymptomatic (none of the criteria are satisfied)
Restbps: Resting Blood pressure (in mmHg, upon admission to the hospital)
Chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dL
Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (likely to be diabetic) 1 = true; 0 = false
RestECG: Resting electrocardiogram results
-- Value 0: normal
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
MaxHR: Greatest number of beats per minute your heart can possibly reach during all-out strenuous exercise.
Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (in mm, achieved by subtracting the lowest ST segment points during exercise and rest)
Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, ST-T abnormalities are considered to be a crucial indicator for identifying presence of ischaemia
-- Value 1: upsloping
-- Value 2: flat
-- Value 3: downsloping
Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. Major cardial vessels are as goes: aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, pulmonary artery (oxygen-poor blood --> lungs), pulmonary veins (oxygen-rich blood --> heart), and coronary arteries (supplies blood to heart tissue).
AHD: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect (heart tissue can't absorb thallium both under stress and in rest); 2 = reversible defect (heart tissue is unable to absorb thallium only under the exercise portion of the test)
AHD: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease
